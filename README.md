Codedamn Hacktoberfest 2023 solved questions

# Day 1: Find the Bug

You have been given a code snippet in the index.js file. You can view the file in the editor.

Running this code gives an error, instead of logging the text, can you find out what's the bug with this code and fix it. You should try to add as minimal characters as possible to fix this.

Hint: Think about what happens when square brackets are used after a string

# Day 2: Generating Hex Codes

You've been given a code snippet that creates random HexCodes for colors, however there seems to be a bug with the code that sometimes return 5 hex digits instead of 6.

Can you find out the bug and fix it. You can modify the function code to always return a proper hexCode. You have been also given a sample snippet to see the hex Codes generated by the function.

Here is how a sample hex Code looks like

'#afc3d1'
af ➔ Represents the Red (R) component in the hexadecimal color system.
c3 ➔ Represents the Green (G) component in the hexadecimal color system.
d1 ➔ Represents the Blue (B) component in the hexadecimal color system.
For testing the code you've written the function should be exported, do not change the default export of the function.

# Day 3: React Counter Bug

Sam is learning React and wanted to create a counter that when clicked on a button increments 3 times. The code written by Sam has been shared with you.

Help Sam figure out why the code only increments by one count instead of 3.

# Day 4: Jokes API

José is trying to make the people who visit their blog page laugh a little, so he's attempting to use a Jokes API to fetch a random joke and display it in the sidebar of his blog.

However, he seems to have hit a roadblock, can you help him debug why he's unable to receive a proper resonse from the Jokes API

The API link used in the getJoke() function is https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke

Here is a sample response from the api

{
"type": "general",
"setup": "What do you get when you cross a rabbit with a water hose?",
"punchline": "Hare spray.",
"id": 234
}
The getJoke() function should return an object with properties setup and punchline to be shown to visitors on the blog.

To complete this challenge you should be familar with the basics of axios which is used here for fetching the joke data.

Make sure that you return a proper object without adding any additional properties to the return type of this function

# Day 5: Get the Middle Value

Chloe is practicing JavaScript, she got a challenge to write a JavaScript Function getMiddleValue() which has a parameter arr should accept an array of numbers and sort the array and return the middle value of the array if length of the array is odd and average of the middle values if the length of the array is even.

She has written her code (which is shared with you in the index.js file), but there seems to a bug which she is unable to figure out. The function doesn't not return the middle number of the array having odd length. Can you help her debug this?

A sample array values are already provided to you to aid you in debugging this. Once you've fixed the bug, run the tests to verify if the bug has been fixed. You have to try to change the as minimal as possible and completely avoid re-writing the code.

All the best!
