# Day 2: Generating Hex Codes

You've been given a code snippet that creates random HexCodes for colors, however there seems to be a bug with the code that sometimes return 5 hex digits instead of 6.

Can you find out the bug and fix it. You can modify the function code to always return a proper hexCode. You have been also given a sample snippet to see the hex Codes generated by the function.

Here is how a sample hex Code looks like

'#afc3d1'
af ➔ Represents the Red (R) component in the hexadecimal color system.
c3 ➔ Represents the Green (G) component in the hexadecimal color system.
d1 ➔ Represents the Blue (B) component in the hexadecimal color system.
For testing the code you've written the function should be exported, do not change the default export of the function.
